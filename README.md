# README

As a continuation of Phase 1 of the project (i.e. Sensor Data Analysis), the primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive data science solution for GoBest Cab, a ride-hailing service company. 
The goal is to create an intuitive and portable machine learning software application that visualizes and analyzes cab data.
The application could provide some insights into the driversâ€™ behaviour, and find out if they are dangerous or safe drivers. 

Phase 2 of the project will include a few steps, advanced data preprocessing like handling imbalanced classes (i.e. SMOTE, applying weights, Oversampling) and handling high dimensional outliers (i.e. Elliptical Envelope, IsolationForest),
building, optimizing and scaling the machine learning models on the huge dataset using Dask, tracking and monitoring the machine learning models on the dataset using MLFlow and deploying the machine learning models as an executable Graphical User Interface using Tkinter,
which will serve as a user-friendly front-end to interact with the underlying machine learning model, promoting user-engagement.
